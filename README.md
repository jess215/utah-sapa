# Utah Spiritual and Paranormal Assistance

## Who is SAPA

Spiritual And Paranormal Assistance, SAPA, is focused on assisting those who have paranormal issues.

Our primary goal in all investigations is to improve the situation.  We guide those who have a paranormal issue on how to take control of the situation.  We hope to enlighten people on the paranormal, so they can take part in resolving their problems with restless spirits.  We believe that if you resolve any issues the spirit may be having you will help the spirit either move on or stop acting out in unwanted ways.

We hope to bring understanding to all parties involved with any investigation that we are a part of, the living and the deceased.  Many times spirits will act out because of a misunderstanding, or because there is something they wish to communicate.  Entering all locations we first find out what the situation is, and then we determine the best way to resolve that situation to create a peaceful environment.

## Residentials and Businesses

Our main focus is on assisting those who may be experiencing the paranormal causing distress in their life.  We not only help the location owners take control of their situation, but we also focus on helping the spirits.  We feel that the most beneficial outcome will be reached once you resolve things with the spirit.  Not only is the spirit finally able to find rest, but the family and/or employees of the residence and/or business are once again in control of their surroundings.

## Tours and Investigations

SAPA will on occasion run tours or investigations that will be open to the public.  These will be at, or below, cost.  This means that what we charge will cover the expense of the investigation, no more.
